This code aims to read data from an sd card, using SPI communication by STM32 microcontroller and, after that, to send these data through a wireless connection. (Sub-GHz)

The code is just a rough sketch. The firmware was not tested on an electronic board.

In the wiki section, there is an image showing the architecture.
